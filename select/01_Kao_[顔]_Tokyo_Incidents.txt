I think I only love your profile
And I yours you look nice from the side ・・・
Were I you, I would have said something better
Like what? I can find nothing to say
"Try to search for・・・"
You don't know me 'cause you do not know yourself
I ther do you・・・ look at yourself
"Try to search for
My face of truth"
-So we touch each other strongly after
The slight in quiry
And play our trump card, and scar ourselves
For life
We are so fine
That is exactly what we have really wanted
-I know you better than you know yourself
That's not possible after all, I've never known you
"Try to show me
Your face of truth"
When I want to put my detector deep in side you,
Just as now,
You shut off the one way in, then hide it away,
Just as now
What's more when you want to go out I want to stay home,
And vice versa
-"lovely!"
You know my profile better than I do,
I imagine, and vice versa
I know your profile better than you, I promise,
And vice versa
-But you'll you never see my front I'll never see your face
And I'll never see your front you'll never see my face-of truth
